                Leprechauns became so attached to Irish culture that they became attached to St Patricks day. In fact they are the whole reason that you are supposed to wear green on St. Patricks day- there is an old legend saying that leprechauns are not able to see
                you if you are wearing green. Leprechauns have became more and more famous with their prevalnce in pop culture and as St. Patricks day has become a more celebrated holiday in the United States. In fact there is even a National Museum of
                Leprechauns in Dublin!
