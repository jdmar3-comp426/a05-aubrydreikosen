            <h2>What Powers Do Leprechauns have?</h2>
            <p>
                Leprechauns do not have any special powers in everyday life. Their only super power is to be exceptionally annoying with all of their pranks which is not technically a superpower- any normal human could do that (see <a href="https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Impractical_Jokers"
                    target="_blank">Impractical Jokers</a>). The one special power they have is to grant wishes to whoever is holding them captive in exchange for their release. Now this sounds pretty nice all we have to do is caputre a leprechaun in order
                to get any wishes granted we want. This is where a leprechauns weakness comes in which we will go into in the next paragraph.

            <p>It is believed that a leprechauns favorite alcohol is Guinness or Whiskey. When leprechauns are drunk they are at their most vulnerable to capture.
