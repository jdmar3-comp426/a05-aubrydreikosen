            <h2>Leprechauns are Cute</h2>
            <p>
                Leprechauns are cute mystical creatures menat for the enjoyment of little kids. Anything used as a mascot for a childrens ceral can not be an evil creature. If we think about other cereal mascots none of them are evil creatures so why would lucky charms
                be the exception to this rule. Sure leprechauns are mischevious but who doesn't love a little mischeif in thier life? Plus if you ever meet a leprechaun supposedly you are near gold and who would hate or be scared of that? Also from a
                physical standpoint they are not very formidable- typically they are 3 feet tall- all you have to do is hold your arm out and they can't attack you.

            <p>
                Leprechauns are disgusting gross creatures that are not meant to be trusted. How could we call something cute and cuddly if can not trust that thing with anything becuase they are always pulling pranks on us. Leprechauns were the center of a fantastic
                horror film series called Leprechaun. Now how could we call something cute and cuddly if it was the center of one of the most famous horror movies to ever exist (1). Leprechauns are evil and have crazy hair- if we think about it no cuddly
                thing has crazy hair and a crzed look in their eye like leprechauns do.

        <p>(1) Is the Leprechaun movie series famous for being the worst/cheesiest horror movie sereis? maybe but still it proves my point. Also side note if you have not seen this movie sereis I highly recommend watching it just for the experience and to
            be able to say you somehow made it through the movie without turning it off.
